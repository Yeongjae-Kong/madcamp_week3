# Disallows non-null assertions using the `!` postfix operator (`no-non-null-assertion`)

TypeScript's `!` non-null assertion operator asserts to the type system that an expression is non-nullable, as in not `null` or `undefined`.
Using assertions to tell the type system new information is often a sign that code is not fully type-safe.
It's generally better to structure program logic so that TypeScript understands when values may be nullable.

### ❌ Incorrect
=======
Using non-null assertions cancels the benefits of the strict null-checking mode.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
>>>>>>> 92030a1a5b086ddccf899c6bd734063c39dae48d

```ts
interface Example {
  property?: string;
}

declare const example: Example;
const includesBaz = example.property!.includes('baz');
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
interface Example {
  property?: string;
}

declare const example: Example;
const includesBaz = example.property?.includes('baz') ?? false;
```

## When Not To Use It

<<<<<<< HEAD
If your project does not use the `strictNullChecks` compiler option, this rule is likely useless to you.
If your code is often wildly incorrect with respect to strict null-checking, your code may not yet be ready for this rule.
=======
If you don't care about strict null-checking, then you will not need this rule.
