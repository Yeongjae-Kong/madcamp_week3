# Exhaustiveness checking in switch with union type (`switch-exhaustiveness-check`)

When working with union types in TypeScript, it's common to want to write a `switch` statement intended to contain a `case` for each constituent (possible type in the union).
However, if the union type changes, it's easy to forget to modify the cases to account for any new types.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This rule reports when a `switch` statement over a value typed as a union of literals is missing a case for any of those literal types and does not have a `default` clause.

### ❌ Incorrect
=======
Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
>>>>>>> 92030a1a5b086ddccf899c6bd734063c39dae48d

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  case 'Tuesday':
    result = 2;
    break;
  case 'Wednesday':
    result = 3;
    break;
  case 'Thursday':
    result = 4;
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    result = 5;
    break;
  case 'Saturday':
    result = 6;
    break;
  case 'Sunday':
    result = 7;
    break;
}
```

or

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  default:
    result = 42;
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't frequently `switch` over union types with many parts, or intentionally wish to leave out some parts.
